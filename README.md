# HTML-Code-editor
This is a html code editor or html IDE. i have made this using html,sass (css) and javascript and some javascript Library. (bootstrap, Jquery,popper)

Bootstrap - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.Bootstrap utilizes Sass for a modular and customizable architecture.

Jquery - jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. 

Popper - Popper. js is a positioning engine, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element to make it possible to position it near a given reference element. Popper. js has zero dependencies.

Hope all the above information will be useful for your learning.
